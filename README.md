# GUI-Recursive-Snake


## What:
A gui demonstration of a snake algorithm that when dropped anywhere into a maze, it will find the apple and show the longest path. The code can be manipulated to also show the shortest path. This project aims to demonstrate a naive brute force/flood fill solution to this problem. The solution uses backtracking by using recursion to check every possible valid path to the apple. Note: this was built in only 9 hours, hence is not suited for scalability.
